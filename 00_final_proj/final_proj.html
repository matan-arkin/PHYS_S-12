  <h3>PHYS S-12: Final Project Proposal </h3>
  <p> Did you know that the speed of sound underwater is about 4 times faster than in air? That’s why when you dive underwater and hear a sound, you can’t tell which direction it’s coming from. Your brain is expecting a certain delay between receiving the noise signal at one ear and receiving it at the other. When SCUBA diving and especially when SCUBA diving for military or construction purposes, this can cause serious trouble. Imagine a mechanic fixing delicate equipment on an oil rig. Should a part of the oil rig collapse overhead, making a noise, the engineer might not identify the source of that noise in time to avoid the perilous hunk of metal heading toward him. Similar situations arise with military SCUBA dives and even recreational dives. <br><br>
    For my final project, I propose a pair of SCUBA goggles with microphones controlled by a microcontroller which, together, monitor surrounding noise and compute a bearing of its source. A visual indicator will signal to the diver, in real time, which direction the noise is coming from. This would aid divers in identifying dangers as well as navigating underwater using reference noises (such as louder engine sounds which could indicate the direction of a boat channel). With only 2 low-quality microphones, a weak microcontroller and some LEDs, this solution could be made extremely cheap. <br><br>
