      <p> Let’s face it, you’re here to read about the PROJECT, not me. And why wouldn’t you? The project is AWESOME and I’m just a guy. My primary quality being that I built this cool project. So if you accidentally wandered over here, or you’re an instructor who will now grade this page, I must direct you to where the real magic happens: <a href='../00_final_proj/final_proj.html'>the final project proposal page</a>. <br><br>
        Then about me: hello! My name is Matan, 22, from Israel, and I’m a Harvard Extension School student majoring in CS (rising senior), a recently discharged soldier from the Israel Defense Forces where I was a cyber researcher and now employed as an embedded developer at a wicked-cool augmented reality startup called Magic Leap! For fun, I enjoy Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, SCUBA diving and basically any other water/snow sport.<br> <br>
        When I completed my military service 9 months ago, I realized cyber research wasn’t quite my thing and that I had a knack for TANGIBLE work. I like seeing things move and interact with the real world. So I dropped everything, locked myself up in a room for 3 months (it was COVID, I’m not a loner), and learned embedded programing on my own as best I could. I read books, bought hardware, wrote a driver, prepared for interview questions – all that good stuff. I found my dream job at Magic Leap. And I might’ve found just the course to go along with it.<br><br>
        If you stayed with me through all this, I’m deeply humbled :)
